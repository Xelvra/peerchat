# Security Policy

## üîí Security Philosophy

Xelvra P2P Messenger is built with security as a fundamental principle. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the security community's efforts to help us maintain the highest security standards.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages encrypted using Signal Protocol
- **Forward Secrecy**: Automatic key rotation protects past communications
- **Metadata Protection**: Onion routing obfuscates communication patterns
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, storage, and rotation

### Network Security
- **NAT Traversal**: Secure hole-punching and relay mechanisms
- **Transport Security**: QUIC and TLS for all network communications
- **Peer Authentication**: Cryptographic verification of peer identities
- **DoS Protection**: Rate limiting and connection management

### Implementation Security
- **Memory Safety**: Secure memory handling and cleanup
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for all dependencies

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 0.1   | ‚ùå No              |

**Note**: As we're in early development (Epoch 1), we currently support only the latest release. Once we reach stable releases, we'll maintain security support for multiple versions.

## üîç Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
**security@xelvra.org**

If this email address is not available, please create a private security advisory on GitHub:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Xelvra/peerchat/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Vulnerability Description**
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Potential impact and severity assessment
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

2. **Technical Details**
   - Affected versions
   - System configuration (OS, architecture)
   - Network environment details
   - Code snippets or proof-of-concept (if applicable)

3. **Suggested Fix**
   - Proposed solution or mitigation (if you have one)
   - Alternative approaches considered

4. **Contact Information**
   - Your preferred contact method
   - Whether you'd like to be credited in the security advisory

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial report kept confidential
2. **Coordinated Fix**: We work with reporters to develop fixes
3. **User Notification**: Users notified of security updates
4. **Public Disclosure**: Details published after fixes are deployed
5. **Credit**: Security researchers credited (if desired)

## üèÜ Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a security researchers hall of fame to recognize those who help improve Xelvra's security:

*Currently empty - be the first to contribute!*

### Bug Bounty Program

We're planning to establish a bug bounty program for security vulnerabilities. Details will be announced when the program launches.

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Identity Protection
- **Backup Your Keys**: Securely backup your `~/.xelvra/` directory
- **Strong Passphrases**: Use strong passphrases for key encryption (when available)
- **Key Rotation**: Allow automatic key rotation (enabled by default)
- **Verify Connections**: Only connect to trusted peers

### Network Security
- **Firewall Configuration**: Properly configure your firewall
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual network activity
- **Update Regularly**: Keep Xelvra updated to the latest version
- **Secure Networks**: Avoid using Xelvra on untrusted networks when possible

### Operational Security
- **Log Management**: Regularly review and rotate logs
- **System Updates**: Keep your operating system updated
- **Antivirus**: Use reputable antivirus software
- **Physical Security**: Secure physical access to your devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

### Code Security
- **Security Reviews**: All code undergoes security review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with tools like gosec
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies
- **Fuzzing**: Automated fuzzing of protocol implementations

### Testing
- **Security Testing**: Dedicated security test suites
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing
- **Chaos Engineering**: Testing resilience under adverse conditions
- **Real-world Testing**: Testing in various network environments

### Release Security
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Builds can be independently verified
- **Secure Distribution**: Secure distribution channels
- **Update Mechanism**: Secure update mechanisms (planned)

## üìã Security Audit History

### Planned Audits
- **External Security Audit**: Planned for Epoch 2 (API Service)
- **Cryptographic Review**: Planned review of encryption implementation
- **Network Security Assessment**: Planned assessment of P2P network security

### Completed Audits
*No external audits completed yet - project is in early development*
